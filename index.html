<h1>Welcome</h1>
Welcome to the journey of one of our latest adventures; the purchase of a 1952 Ford F1 pickup truck! 
This classic truck has a timeless look, rich history and a charm that instantly grabbed our attention when we came upon it in the Summer of 2024. 
The Ford F1 is more than just a vehicle; it's a piece of automotive history. 
Join us as we dive into the restoration process, share stories from the road, and celebrate the timeless appeal of this iconic truck. 
Whether you're a fellow classic car enthusiast or just curious about our adventure, we hope you'll enjoy following along as we bring this old gem back to life..<br><br>
