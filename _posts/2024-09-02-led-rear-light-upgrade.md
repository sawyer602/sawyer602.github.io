For the first month of driving around in the F1 we always asked for friends to follow us since the taillights were always super dim.  Safety items were something we both agreed to put at the top of our repair lists.
With a 6V system, the options were very limited - glad where we ended up.
I started looking at the system first.  Volts and Amps all seemed to be where we expected them and from what I read, we were getting about the best we could from the standard 1157 bulbs.
Off to the store and Google.
At our local parts store.
Next up, I found Headlight Experts
I finally ended up finding one product on Amazon.
