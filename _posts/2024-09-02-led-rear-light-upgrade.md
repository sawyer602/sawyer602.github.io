For the first month of driving around in the F1 we always asked for friends to follow us since the taillights were always super dim.  Safety items were something we both agreed to put at the top of our repair lists.
With a 6V system, the options were very limited - glad where we ended up.
I started looking at the system first.  Volts and Amps all seemed to be where we expected them and from what I read, we were getting about the best we could from the standard 115
