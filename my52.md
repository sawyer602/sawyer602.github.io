On the way home after a June 2024 family gathering in Standish Maine, we came about the F1 by chance after missing our turn.  It was sitting aside the road at the end of Randalls Apple Orchards on Rt 25.  A few phone calls later and a pass on some buyers from Massachuets, the F1 was ours.

Here is what we know about her:

1952 Ford F1

6 Cyl OHV 215
