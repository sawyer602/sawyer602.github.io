On the way home after a June 2024 family gathering in Standish Maine, we came about the F1 by chance after missing our turn.  It was sitting aside the road at the end of [Randall's Apple Orchards](https://www.randallorchards.com/) on Rt 25.  A few phone calls later and a pass on some buyers from Massachusetts, the F1 was ours.
